### Some feature not work...
I use this project project for learn java and frameworks.
Really, some feature may not works correctly or works strange.
If you seen a bug or a bad code, please, create an issue.

### Run
I'm recommend to run it with `-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=15 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=45`, it's save a lot of RAM =)
